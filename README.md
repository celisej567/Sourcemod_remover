# Sourcemod_remover
This is a spetial program that i wrote for "a joke" with my friend that can find/delete `sourcemod` folder in _almost_ any disk in about a seconds.



This solution have two projects, one of them is a console application that will show you everything that he does. The second one are "console-less" application that works faster, but dont show you anything and bigger in size. 



### THIS PROGRAM ARE SAFE BY DEFAULT!!!!
Console version will only show where he found `sourcemod` folder. "Console-less" version will not do anything. To enable DANGER mode you need to remove comment from `fs::remove_all` part. Also you can enable other debug stuff for console version, but it will slow down speed of the program.
